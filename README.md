# Flash Forge Creator Max Profile

This repository is intended to allow collaboration on the creation of a [Cura](https://ultimaker.com/software/ultimaker-cura) profile for the Creator Max printer from [FlashForge](https://flashforge.com)

## Current Status
As of right now none of this is working. Please see the wiki for the research so far.

## Some notes on reading files
The creator max appears to read files with either .gcode or .g extensions. However it is important to note that if the file name is too long, the file will not open properly and the print will not start.
